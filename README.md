### Setting up
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd fyp2`
3. Run `php composer.phar install`

>To get started, you require a `.env` file in the root folder. Rename the `env_sample` file to `.env`. This file houses the secret credentials you don't want on the source code. Fill them out.

>To load this file to src, we use [vlucas' phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv). Follow the installation guide to install it using `composer` (although it's already in the `composer.json` so just check it out)

3. Run the `index.html` in your browser.
